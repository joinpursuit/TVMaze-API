# TVMaze API

Practice working with the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) and DOM methods!

See a live demo here:

## The Searching

You should be presented with a text input when first loading the site. Clicking the Search button makes a request to the tvmaze api with whatever you typed into the input.

https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search

Once the results are returned, you should append each result to the select dropdown.

## The Results 

Once you select an option from the dropdown, it should display the title, image, and description for that show.

## Bonus

* Add a button that says "Show schedule". When clicked, it displays the time(s) and day(s) of week the show plays.
* Add a button that says "Show seasons". When clicked it displays each season's start date, end date, network, and season number.
